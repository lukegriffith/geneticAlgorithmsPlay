Playing around with Genetic Algorithms

The goal of this program is to get a population of 6, 8 
bit binary strings to 0.

The fittest chromosome gets to breed twice, with the 
worst being unable to breed.  

Random chance of mutation occurs once per generation, 
ensuring a solution does not get trapped on a local
optimum.
